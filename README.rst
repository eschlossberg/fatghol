FatGHoL is a Python library for generating and manipulating Penner Fatgraphs.

The main driver for developing FatGHoL is the computation of the
rational cohomology of the moduli space of smooth punctured Riemann
surfaces Mg,n. The computations completed with FatGHoL so far are
available for `download from GitHub`_, FigShare_, or the `Google Code Archive`_.

If you're interested, you can start reading the documentation_ right away.

The algorithms used in FatGHoL are described in the `arXiv pre-print
1202.1820`_. Feel free to email me_ with questions and suggestions.
