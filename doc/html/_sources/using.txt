 Using FatGHoL
---------------

FatGHoL comes with a front-end script to compute the (co)homology of
the moduli space of marked smooth Riemann surfaces (using Kontsevich'
"graph homology" complex).

The front-end script is called ``mgn.sh``; you can invoke it with the
``--help`` command line option to get a recap of its functionality::

  $ ./mgn.sh --help
  usage: mgn [-h] [-D [DEBUG]] [-l LOGFILE] [-o OUTFILE] [-s CHECKPOINT_DIR]
             [-u] [-v] [-V]
             ACTION [ARG [ARG ...]]

      Actions:

        graphs G N
          Generate the graphs occurring in M_{g,n}.

        homology G N
          Print homology ranks of M_{g,n}.

        latex G N [-s DIR] [-o FILE]
          Read the listings of M_{g,n} fatgraphs (from directory DIR)
          and output a pretty-print catalogue of the graphs as LaTeX documents.

        valences G N
          Print the vertex valences occurring in M_{g,n} graphs.

        shell
          Start an interactive PyDB shell.

        selftest
          Run internal code tests and report failures.


  positional arguments:
    ACTION                Action to perform, see above.
    ARG                   Arguments depend on the actual action, see above.

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -D [DEBUG], --debug [DEBUG]
                          Enable debug features:
                              * pydb -- run Python debugger if an error occurs
                              * profile -- dump profiler statistics in a .pf file.
                              Several features may be enabled by separating them
                              with a comma, as in '-D pydb,profile'.
    -l LOGFILE, --logfile LOGFILE
                          Redirect log messages to the named file
                              (by default log messages are output to STDERR).
    -o OUTFILE, --output OUTFILE
                          Save results into named file.
    -s CHECKPOINT_DIR, --checkpoint CHECKPOINT_DIR
                          Directory for saving computation state.
    -u, --afresh          Do NOT restart computation from the saved state in checkpoint directory.
    -v, --verbose         Print informational and status messages as the computation goes on.
    -V, --version         show program's version number and exit


That should be pretty much self-explanatory; however a bit more detail
is given below.

The ``graphs`` action
---------------------

With ``./mgn.sh graphs 0 4`` (for example) you can print a list of
all the fatgraphs having genus 0 and 4 boundary cycles.  If you want
to save the list to a file, use the ``-o`` option, followed by the
file name.

The list of fatgraphs is also saved in directory ``M0,4.data/`` in several
``.list`` files, depending on the number of vertices.  For instance,
the ``M0,4-MgnGraphsIterator3.list`` file is the one collecting
fatgraphs with 3 vertices.


The ``homology`` action
-----------------------

With ``./mgn.sh homology 0 4`` (for example), you can print the Betti
numbers of the moduli space of smooth marked Riemann surfaces having
genus 0 and 4 marked points.  If you want to save the result to a
file, use the ``-o`` option, followed by the file name.

Internally, the ``homology`` function uses the ``graphs`` function, so
it generates all by-products of that function.  In particular, graphs
lists are generated and saved in the `checkpoint directory`_
(``M0,4.data`` in this example).

In addition to graph lists, the boundary operator matrices are
computed and saved in the `checkpoint directory`_.  After their ranks
have been computed, they are saved as well, so invoking the
``homology`` action with a fully-populated `checkpoint directory`_ gives
the result almost istantaneously.


The ``latex`` action
--------------------

This reads the contents of an existing checkpoint directory and
generates a LaTeX report on all the graphs: what graphs are there,
their automorphisms and markings, etc.

To save the report into a file, use the ``-o`` option followed by the
file name, e.g.::

  ./mgn.sh latex 0 4 -o report.tex

The name of the `checkpoint directory`_ is automatically generated
from the parameters *G* and *N*; use the ``-s`` option to use a
different directory.


The ``valence`` action
----------------------

This prints the valences of vertices of fatgraphs with given genus and
number of boundary cycles.

As this is a very simple computation, nothing is saved to the
`checkpoint directory`_.


Checkpoint directory
--------------------

This is a directory where FatGHoL saves result of
computationally-expensive functions.  When FatGHoL is invoked again at
a later time, it loads the results from the checkpoint directory
instead of calculating them again; this results in a substantial
speedup.  However, you can use the ``-u`` command-line option to tell
FatGHoL to ignore the contents of a checkpoint directory.

The name of the `checkpoint directory`_ is automatically generated
from the parameters *G* and *N*; use the ``-s`` option to use a
different directory.

There is no way of avoiding that FatGHoL creates a checkpoint
directory and populates it.
