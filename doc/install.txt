 Installation of FatGHoL
--------------------------

.. note::

   Although it is *theoretically* possible to install FatGHoL in
   Windows or MacOSX, I have never attempted that.

   Therefore, **the following instructions are Linux-only.**

These instructions show how to install FatGHoL from its `source
repository`_ into a separate directory. This has the advantage that
all code is confined in a single directory, and can thus be easily
replaced/removed.  The instructions can be easily adapted to
system-wide installation by anyone having a bit of familiarity with
Linux system administration.

Although FatGHoL is a pure-`Python`_ module, it depends on the LinBox_
exact linear algebra library for computing the rank of homology
matrices.  Unfortunately, this complicates the installation procedure:
LinBox_ depends on several other libraries, which must be downloaded
and compiled.  The sections below detail what should be installed in
order to get a working FatGHoL installation.


Initial installation
====================

0. The prerequisite of prerequisites: C++ compiler and SVN
----------------------------------------------------------

Before you install anything else, you need to have a working C and C++
compiler on the system, and the SubVersion_ (SVN) source control system.
This is generally not a problem on Linux systems, which come with the
GCC_ compiler preinstalled, and SVN is available as an optional
package.  To check if you have a C++ compiler installed, type the
following commands at your shell prompt::

  c++ --version; svn --version

If you get output similar to the following (the version number and
copyright may vary), then everything is OK::

  c++ (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.1-9ubuntu3) 4.6.1
  Copyright (C) 2011 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
  warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  svn, version 1.6.12 (r955767)
   compiled Aug  5 2011, 17:07:24

  Copyright (C) 2000-2009 CollabNet.
  Subversion is open source software, see http://subversion.tigris.org/
  ...

If you instead get a "command not found" error, then you need to
install the C/C++ compiler and SVN:

* On Debian_ and Ubuntu_, install packages ``subversion``, ``gcc`` and
  ``g++``::

    sudo apt-get install subversion gcc g++

* On Fedora_, RHEL_, or CentOS_, install packages ``subversion``,
  ``gcc`` and ``gcc-c++``::

    # run this command as "root" user
    yum install subversion gcc gcc-c++

* On other Linux distributions, please refer to your distribution
  website for instructions.


1. Download the FatGHoL sources into the installation directory
---------------------------------------------------------------

Check-out the ``fatghol`` files into the installation directory::

    svn checkout http://fatghol.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ "$HOME/fatghol"
    cd "$HOME/fatghol"

In this step and in the following ones, the directory
``$HOME/fatghol`` is be the installation folder of FatGHoL.  You can
change this to another directory path; any directory that's
writable by your Linux account will be OK.


2. Install auxiliary libraries and software
-------------------------------------------

This is the crucial step: we're now going to install all the software
required by FatGHoL and LinBox_ in one go.  

On Debian_ and Ubuntu_, the required software is already available as
optional system packages, so it can be installed with ease; an
installation script is provided for other Linux systems, which
should be able to install the required software without assistance.

* On Debian_ and Ubuntu_ systems, the following command should install
  all the required software::

    sudo apt-get install python-dev swig liblinbox-dev 

* On other systems, you may want to use the ``prereq.sh`` script that
  you can find in the FatGHoL installation directory.  Invoking the
  script like this::

    cd $HOME/fatghol
    ./prereq.sh

  will download and install all necessary dependencies into a
  directory ``sw`` (created inside the FatGHoL installation
  directory). 

  You can edit the initial section of the ``prereq.sh`` script to
  select what software needs to be installed on your system.  The
  default is to install all dependencies.

  .. note::

    The ``prereq.sh`` script may take a very long time to complete;
    especially the compilation of the linear algebra library ATLAS can
    take hours!

    On the other hand, if you interrupt the script, just invoke it
    again with ``./prereq.sh`` and it should be able to pick up from
    whence it left.

* If the script does not work, you may want to attempt installation
  from source of the packages, according to the instructions given on
  the respective websites.  These are the packages needed by
  FatGHoL: 

  - Python_, version (at least) 2.6
  - SWIG_ (version 1.3.40 is known to work well with FatGHoL)
  - LinBox_, at least version 1.1.6

  Note that the ``./mgn.sh`` script for running graph homology
  computations expects the libraries to be available in the ``sw``
  directory withing the FatGHoL installation directory.


3. Install FatGHoL
------------------

Last step: run the ``setup.py`` script to compile the glue code that
links FatGHoL with LinBox_::

  cd $HOME/fatghol
  python setup.py develop

.. note::

   If you have installed Python with the installation script
   ``prereq.py``, then you need to type the following command *before*
   you run ``setup.py``, to be sure it is executed by the Python
   interpreter installed in step 2.::

     PATH=$HOME/fatghol/sw/bin:$PATH
     export PATH


4. Check your installation
--------------------------

Now you can check your FatGHoL installation; just type the command:: 

    ./mgn.sh selftest

and you should see the following output appear on your screen
(elapsed times will of course be different)::

    Module 'rg' OK, passed all doctests.
    Module 'homology' OK, passed all doctests.
    Module 'graph_homology' OK, passed all doctests.
    Module 'combinatorics' OK, passed all doctests.
    Module 'iterators' OK, passed all doctests.
    Module 'cyclicseq' OK, passed all doctests.

Upgrade
=======

These instructions show how to upgrade the FatGHoL scripts to the
latest version found in the `source repository`_.

1. `cd` to the directory containing the FatGHoL virtualenv;
   assuming it's named ``fatghol`` as in the above installation
   instructions, you can issue the commands::

     cd $HOME/fatghol # use '/opt/fatghol' if root

2. Upgrade the `fatghol` source and run the `setup.py` script again::

     svn update
     export PATH=$HOME/fatghol/sw/bin:$PATH
     python setup.py develop



HTML Documentation
==================

HTML documentation for the FatGHoL programming interface can be read
online at:

  http://fatghol.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/html/index.html

You can also generate a local copy from the sources::

  cd $HOME/fatghol # use '/opt/fatghol' if root
  cd doc
  make html

Note that you need the Python package `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`
in order to build the documentation locally.
